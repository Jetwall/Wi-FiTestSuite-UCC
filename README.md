Wi-Fi Test Suite - UCC (Unified Command Console)
Latest Release: v9.0.0

-- Introduction --

UCC runs tests defined by input text files containing CAPI commands. The individual CAPI
commands within the input files are handled by UCC to perform functions such as DUT
configuration, traffic stream definition, and test execution. UCC will direct specific CAPI
commands to the appropriate device. This is accomplished via the Control Network.
